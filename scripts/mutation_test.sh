#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Mutation-testing driver for mega-evm.
#
# Subcommands:
#   diff  <base-ref>   Mutate only lines changed vs <base-ref> (PR gate mode).
#   full  [args...]    Mutate the whole mega-evm crate (nightly mode; slow).
#                      Extra arguments go to cargo-mutants (e.g. `-f <file>`).
#   file  <glob>       Mutate files matching <glob> (local iteration).
#
# Every run first builds the unmutated tests into ./target, which cargo-mutants'
# `copy_target` copies into each scratch build directory, then runs cargo-mutants.
# Results land in $OUT_DIR/mutants.out/ (missed.txt, caught.txt, outcomes.json).
# Run scripts/mutation_gate.py afterwards to score + gate the run.
#
# Time budget: MUTANTS_BUDGET=<seconds>, counted from this script's start, bounds
# the warm build and cargo-mutants together (unset: no limit; needs GNU timeout).
# When it runs out, the running phase gets SIGINT, so cargo-mutants stops its
# in-flight mutants and keeps every outcome it has recorded; it gets SIGKILL if it
# is still running MUTANTS_GRACE seconds later. The script then exits 0 with what
# was tested, so the caller can still score and upload it.
#
# The last line printed, also written to $OUT_DIR/status, is
#   MUTANTS-STATUS status=<status> expected=<n|unknown> outcomes=<n>
# expected: mutants planned (unknown if the run stopped before cargo-mutants
# planned them); outcomes: mutants with an outcome; status is one of
#   complete         every planned mutant has an outcome;
#   partial          the budget ran out after some mutants were tested;
#   not-started      the budget ran out before any mutant was tested;
#   baseline-failed  the unmutated tree failed to build or to pass its tests;
#   error            the run itself failed (bad arguments, an internal error).
# Only baseline-failed and error exit non-zero. `mutation_gate.py report --status`
# fails the gate on anything but complete.
